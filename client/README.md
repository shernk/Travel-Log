  * [ ] Design Pattern to single file

  ** [ ] list all longitude & latitude
  ** Already have list logEntry on listLogEntries function(API file)
  ** To take LngLat of DragStart use latitude & longtitude on database => create function to take each location's LngLat

  * [ ] Delete location
  * [ ] Update location
  * [ ] Take the title when drag
  * [x] onDragEnd & onDragStart & onDrag are works

  /**

  *! [ ] Hide its logEntryForm when dragged end

  */
  * [x] Take lngLat location and show logEntryForm to input new info when dragged end
  * [ ] Show title when drag begin on control-panel: Draggable Maker: title

  ### Come-up with an idea:

  *** When drag end, show alert "Do you really want connect  onMarkerStartLocation to onMarkerEndLocation. Show logEntry form to create new location. Then show the line map from start to end location(get name of location by title)

  * [ ] When drag end, show alert "Do you want connect onMarkerStartLocation to onMarkerEndLocation?"
  * [x] Show logEntry form to create new location
  * [ ] Show the line map from start to end location
