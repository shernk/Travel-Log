  * [] Delete location
  * [] Update location
  * [] Take the title when drag
  * [x] onDragEnd & onDragStart & onDrag are works
  * [x] Take lngLat location and show logEntryForm to input new info when dragged end
  * [ ] Show title when drag begin on control-panel: Draggable Maker: title

  /**

  *! [] Hide its logEntryForm when dragged end

  */
  
  ### Come-up with an idea:
  
  *** Have 2 ways to create new logEntryForm
  * [x] Create by double click on spot
  * [] Drag marker to another location

  /** 

  *TODO: [] Hide logEntryForm of marker have already existed after dragged end

  *TODO: [] Create by drag marker already have exist on map which means its location have to delete after dragged marker to another location and will show new logEntry form simultaneouly

  */
